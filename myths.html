<p>Menstruation is a phenomenon unique to girls. However, it has always been surrounded by taboos and myths that exclude women from many aspects of socio-cultural life. In India, the topic has been a taboo until date. Such taboos about menstruation present in many societies impact on girls’ and women's emotional state, mentality and lifestyle and most importantly, health. The challenge, of addressing the socio-cultural taboos and beliefs in menstruation, is further compounded by the low girls’ knowledge levels and understandings of puberty, menstruation, and reproductive health. Thus, there is the need to follow a strategic approach in combating these issues. The current paper aims to discuss menstruation related myths prevalent in India, their impact on women's life, relevance of addressing these issues in primary care and a brief description about various strategies to combat them.</p>



<li>Menstruation Myth1:</li>
<p>This myth exists in parts of the world ranging from Bali and India to Nepal. Women are believed to be “unclean” while menstruating and are thus not allowed to enter “clean” and holy places like temples. This is a form of gender inequality that limits women from the same human rights like freedom to practice religion that men have access to. Girls and women menstruating are not unclean. They are normal, natural, and healthy. The myth that women cannot enter temples and holy ground is culturally controversial, and a sensitive issue. When women are treated differently because of a naturally occurring body cycle it creates shame, taboos, and humiliation towards periods that is deeply embedded into society. And that is the only thing that’s ridiculous</p>

<li>Menstruation Myth2:</li>
<p>“You’re supposed to get your period at least by the time you’re ”
There is no set age at which young girls should get their first period. Girls as young as nine years of age may start menstruating while some may start at the age of 15. If by the age of 15, a girl doesn’t get her periods, it is better to consult a doctor.
This particular myth plagues young women, girls and mothers alike. Sadly, if the girl misses her mark, i.e. if she turns 13 years and even one week old, and if she hasn’t started her period still, there is a problem with her!</p>
<li>Menstruation Myth3:</li>
“Your period lasts for exactly one week.”
<p>Shockingly, not all women’s bodies are the same, so women’s menstrual cycles also differ. The 28 days cycle is an average marker and not set in stone. No one is perfect and therefore; the menstruation cycle is also not accurate. Women have irregular periods for various reasons. Teenagers too, do not have the typical cycle of 28 days. The gap between periods may vary from 21 days to 35 days.</p>
<li>Menstruation Myth4:<img src="mit.jpg" alt=""></li>
<p>“Eating sour foods will worsen menstrual cramps.”
Seriously… there is no connection between menstrual cramps and eating sour foods. However, it is essential for women to maintain a healthier diet during this period. It is best to eat beans, pulses, roti, brown bread, and yogurt.

</p>
<li>Menstruation Myth5:</li>
<p>“You shouldn’t wash your hair during your period.”
Thank goodness this is a myth! There is no reason to follow this idea as bathing and regular grooming rituals have no connection with one’s menses. Taking warm baths twice a day will only help feel lighter as they ease muscle cramps</p>

<li>Menstruation Myth6:</li>


<p>In India and parts of Nepal (in alignment with the chaupadi tradition in Nepal). Myth number eight says that women cannot interact with or touch men because men will become sick by touching an “unclean” woman. Some 20% of girls in rural India believe they should not talk to a male member of the family during menstruation.
And 40% of girls in India learn about menstruation from their mothers. So, if external education is not provided these traditions will persist.</p>
<li>Menstruation Myth7:</li>

<p>70 percent of women still use old rags to soak the flow
Only 12% of India's 355 million menstruating women use sanitary napkins (SNs). Over 88% of women resort to shocking alternatives like unsanitised cloth, ashes and husk sand. Around 23% of these girls actually drop out of school after they started menstruating. The biggest barrier to using a sanitary napkin is affordability. These are the findings of the latest study, "Sanitary Protection: Every Woman's Health Right”.</p>
<li>Menstruation Myth8:</li>
<p>Buying Sanitary Napkins is embarrassing
It is not just the women but even men find buying sanitary napkins for their women embarrassing! Seventy five percent women in India buy sanitary napkins wrapped in a brown bag or newspaper, because of the shame associated with menstruation. They also never ask a male member of the family to buy sanitary towels or tampons</p>

  <div class="conc">Strategies to Combat Menstruation Related Myths
Based on the available evidence, it is pertinent to follow a strategic approach for combating the myths and social taboos associated with menstruation in order to improve the reproductive health of adolescent girls and women. The first and foremost strategy in this regard is raising the awareness among the adolescent girls related to menstrual health and hygiene. Young girls often grow up with limited knowledge of menstruation because their mothers and other women shy away from discussing the issues with them. Adult women may themselves not be aware of the biological facts or good hygienic practices, instead passing on cultural taboos and restrictions to be observed.[1] Community based health education campaigns could prove worthwhile in achieving this task. There is also need to spread awareness among the school teachers regarding menstruation</div>
