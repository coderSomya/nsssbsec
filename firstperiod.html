       <b> What causes menstruation?</b>
<p>Menstruation is a result of puberty. This is when your body becomes capable of reproduction.</p>

<p>
    <p>•	When your menstrual cycle begins, your estrogen levels increase. That causes the lining of your uterus to thicken</p>
        <p>•	The uterine lining thickens so it can support a fertilized egg and develop into a pregnancy.</p>
            <p>•	If there isn’t a fertilized egg, your body will break the lining down and push it out of your uterus. This results in bleeding — your menstrual period</p>
                <p>•	It doesn’t matter if you’ve had a period for years or you’re waiting for your first one — periods can be difficult to navigate</p>
                    <p>•	This article will go over everything you need to know, from how to find the right menstrual products and dealing with cramps to saving stained clothes</p>

<div class="when"></div>
<b>When will I get my first period?</b>
<p>Most people start their periods between the ages of 12 and 13.Trusted Source However, it’s normal to start your period a little earlier or later, too.
As a general rule of thumb, menstruation will start about two years after your breasts begin to develop.
What signs should I look for?</p>
<p>people start their periods without any warning. Others may experience premenstrual syndrome (PMS) in the days leading up to their period.
Symptoms of PMS include:</p>
<p>•	acne</p>
<p>•	abdominal bloating</p>
<p>•	soreness in your breasts</p>
<p>•	back pain</p>
<p>•	constipation</p>
<p>•	diarrhoea</p>
<p>•	feeling more tired than usual (fatigue)</p>

<p>You may find it helpful to carry a “period kit” in your bag so you’re not caught completely off guard when your period begins.
This may include a clean pair of underwear,
pad or tampon,
wipe,
pain reliever, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol).</p>
<b>My period just started — what should I do?</b>


<p>If you’ve started your period and don’t have something to use for the blood, try not to worry. You can fashion a temporary pad out of toilet paper to hold things over until you’re able to get a proper pad or tampon.</p>
Here’s how:
<p>1.	Take a long section (at least 10 squares) of toilet paper and fold the layers over each other.</p>
<p>2.	Place this where a pad would go — along the panel of fabric between your legs (called the gusset) that’s in the middle section of your underwear.</p>
<p>3.	Take another length of toilet paper and wrap it around the “pad” and your underwear a few times. This will help hold the tissue in place.</p>
<p>4.	Tuck the end of the tissue into the top of the finished wrap. You now have a makeshift pad.</p>
If you’re at school, you may consider asking your teacher or nurse for a pad or tampon. They’ve been asked before — trust us.</p>
<b>How long will it last?</b>
<p>Your first period may only last a couple of days.
    It may take a couple of months for your period to settle into a regular schedule and consistency.</p>

    <b>What can I use to stop the bleeding?</b>
<p>Once it does, your period may last anywhere from two to seven days each month.</p>

<p>Your period is a part of your menstrual cycle. This means that, with time, your period will usually be on a predictable pattern.
The average menstrual cycle is about 28 days. Some people have one that lasts 21 to 45 days. That’s completely normal, too.
It may take up to 6 years after your first period for menstruation to occur at a regular interval.That’s because your body has to learn how to release and regulate your reproductive hormones.</p>
<b>Will I have periods forever?</b>
<p>You won’t have a period for the rest of your life, but you’ll probably have it for quite some time.
Most people will have a menstrual period until they go through menopause. Menopause occurs when the hormones that increased to trigger your first period begin to decrease.
Menopause typically begins between ages 45 to 55</p></div>
