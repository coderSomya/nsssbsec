        <b>What is Menstrual Hygiene? </b>

        Menstrual Hygiene Management (MHM) is defined as:
        <div class="women">â€œWomen and adolescent girls are using clean menstrual management materials to absorb or
            collect blood that can be changed in privacy as often as necessary for the duration of the menstruation
            period, using soap and water for washing the body as required, and having access to facilities to dispose of
            used menstrual management materials"
            Most of us go through our periods very secretively and don't really bother to figure out if our practices
            are hygienic or not. At times, we may wear the same napkin for a whole day. Women is villages and smaller
            towns still use reusable unhygienic cloth during their periods. And since periods are considered unclean,
            they are not even allowed to use detergent for washing the soiled cloth well in some households.
            Here are some tips to maintain hygiene during your periods, some of which you may not know about:</div>



        <b>1. Choose your method of sanitation:</b>
        <p>Today there are a number of ways including the use of sanitary napkins, tampons and menstrual cups to stay
            clean. In India, most unmarried girls prefer to use sanitary napkins. If you do decide to use a tampon
            remember that it is essential to choose one that has the lowest absorbency rate for your flow. While there
            are some women who choose to use either different types of sanitary napkins on different days of their
            periods or different methods of protection (like a tampon and a sanitary napkin), there are some who prefer
            to stick to one type and brand. The best tip here is to try and use one brand for one type of protection for
            a while to know if it helps your needs. Frequent switching between brands can make you uncomfortable since
            brands are as unique as you, they suit everyone differently.</p>

        <b>2. Change regularly:</b>
        <p>Menstrual blood - once it has left the body - gets contaminated with the body's innate organisms. This rule
            applies for even those days when you don t have much bleeding, since your pad is still damp and will have
            organisms from your vagina, sweat from your genitals, etc. When these organisms remain in a warm and moist
            place for a long time they tend to multiply and can lead to conditions like urinary tract infection, vaginal
            infections and skin rashes.
            The standard time to change a sanitary pad is once every six hours, while for a tampon is once every two
            hours. That being said, you have to customize the changing schedule to your needs. While some women might
            have a heavy flow and would need to change more often, others will need to change less frequently. There are
            a few instances where your sanitary napkin or tampon might not be completely used usually on days when you
            have a lesser flow but you must change at regular intervals.
            In the case of tampons it is very important because, if left inserted into the vagina for long periods of
            time it can cause a condition called TSS or toxic shock syndrome a condition where bacteria infiltrate the
            body leading to severe infection that can send to the body into shock that requires emergent treatment and
            can lead to serious complications and even death.</p>

        <b>3. Wash yourself regularly:</b>
        <p>When you menstruate, the blood tends to enter tiny spaces like the skin between your labia or crust around
            the opening of the vagina and you should always wash this excess blood away. This practice also tends to
            beat bad odour from the vaginal region. So, it is important to wash your vagina and labia (the projecting
            part of female genitals) well before you change into a new pad. If you cannot wash yourself before you
            change make sure to wipe off the areas using toilet paper or tissue.</p>

        <b>4. Don t use soaps or vaginal hygiene products:</b>
        <p>The vagina has its own cleaning mechanism that works in a very fine balance of good and bad bacteria. Washing
            it with soap can kill the good bacteria making way for infections. So, while it is important to wash
            yourself regularly during this time, all you need to use is some warm water. You can use soap on the
            external parts but do not use it inside your vagina or vulva.</p>

        <b>5. Use the right washing technique:</b>
        <p>Always wash or clean the area in a motion that is from the vagina to the anus. Never wash in the opposite
            direction. Washing in the opposite direction can cause bacteria from the anus to lodge in the vagina and
            urethral opening, leading to infections. Read about urinary tract infections.</p>

        <b>6. Discard your used sanitary product properly:</b>
        <p>It is essential to discard your used napkins or tampons properly because they are capable of spreading
            infections, will smell very foul. Wrapping it well before discarding it ensures that the smell and infection
            is contained. It is advised not to flush the pad or tampon down the toilet since they are capable of forming
            a block and can cause the toilet to back up. More importantly it is imperative that you wash your hands well
            after you discard your used napkin since you are likely to touch the used portion of the pad or tampon while
            discarding it.</p>

        <b>7. Beware of a pad rash:</b>
        <p>A pad rash is something that you might experience during a period of heavy flow. It usually occurs when the
            pad has been wet for a long time and rubs along the thighs causing it to chaff. To prevent this from
            occurring, try to stay dry during your periods. If you do have a rash, change your pads regularly and stay
            dry. Apply an antiseptic ointment, after a bath and before bed this will heal the rash and prevent further
            chaffing. If it gets worse do visit your doctor who will be able to prescribe you a medicated powder that
            can keep the area dry.</p>



        <b>8. Have a bath regularly:</b>
        <p>To some it may seem like the most inane advice, but in some cultures it is believed that a woman should not
            bathe during her periods. This myth was based on the fact that in the olden days women had to bathe in the
            open or in common water bodies like a river or lake. But with indoor plumbing having a bath is the best
            thing you can do for your body during your periods. Bathing not only cleanses your body but also gives you a
            chance to clean your private parts well. It also helps relieve menstrual cramps, backaches, helps improve
            your mood and makes you feel less bloated. To get some relief from backaches and menstrual cramps, just
            stand under a shower of warm water that is targeted towards your back or abdomen. You will feel much better
            at the end of it.</p>
        <b>9. Be ready with on-the-go stuff during your periods</b>
        <p>When you have your periods it is important to be ready. It is important to have extra sanitary pads or
            tampons properly stored in a clean pouch or paper bag, a soft towel, some paper tissues or towels, hand
            sanitizer, a healthy snack, bottle of drinking water, a tube of antiseptic medication (if you are using
            one).</p>
